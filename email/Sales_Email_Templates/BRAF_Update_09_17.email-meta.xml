    <subject>Important NSCLC Update - BRAF V600E</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Dr. {!Contact.LastName}

New approval: FDA approves combination therapy for NSCLC patients with a BRAF V600E mutation.

The FDA recently approved dabrafenib and trametinib (TAFINLAR® and MEKINIST®) for NSCLC patients with a BRAF V600E mutation after this combination demonstrated superior efficacy vs. single agent dabrafenib (60% ORR v. 27% ORR)[1]. Guardant360 includes this crucial oncogene as part of its comprehensive, non-invasive liquid biopsy panel.

This recent approval adds BRAF V600E to the growing list of genomic targets – EGFR, ALK, ROS1, and PDL-1 – that are found in many NSCLC patients. Recent data has shown that 92% of patients are NOT tested for all guideline-recommended genomic alterations because of limited tissue, test turnaround time, and patient performance status[2].

Given the recent change in the treatment landscape, your current NSCLC patients may be eligible for this targeted combination therapy if they have a BRAF V600E mutation. To support you in identifying patients in your practice who may be eligible for this new treatment option, I can put together a custom de-identified list of all your NSCLC patients you tested using Guardant360 in the last 6 months, highlighting those positive for BRAF V600E. I can review this report with you at your office, and include a member of our medical affairs team if you have any clinical questions.  

For any of your NSCLC patients for whom Guardant360 may be appropriate, including those not originally evaluated for BRAF, we also offer a convenient mobile phlebotomy option where blood can be drawn at the patient’s home. Results can be expected in less than 10 days.

Please let me know if I can prepare the custom de-identified BRAF report for you.

Best,
