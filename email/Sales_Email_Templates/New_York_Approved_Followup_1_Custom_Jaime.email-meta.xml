    <textOnly>Hello again.

I wanted to put this back on the top of your inbox. Guardant360 is now New York DOH approved.

Are you in need of sample collection kits? I can drop by at your convenience.

Enjoy the Holiday,

Hello,

Did you hear? The #1 ordered comprehensive liquid biopsy is now New York State Department of Health approved! That means you can order the Guardant360 assay for your advanced cancer patients without completing a DOH waiver.

Is your practice fully stocked with Guardant360 sample collection kits? I can drop by at your convenience with some fresh supplies and review our latest panel updates. When is the best day next week for a visit?
