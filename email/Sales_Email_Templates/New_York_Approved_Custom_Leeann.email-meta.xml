    <subject>Guardant360 is New York Approved</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello,

Did you hear? The #1 ordered comprehensive liquid biopsy is now New York State Department of Health approved! That means you can order the Guardant360 assay for your advanced cancer patients without completing a DOH waiver.

Is your practice fully stocked with Guardant360 sample collection kits? I can drop by at your convenience with some fresh supplies and review our latest panel updates. When is the best day next week for a visit?
