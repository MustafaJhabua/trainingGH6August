    <subject>NCCN Update: NSCLC guidelines now include plasma for molecular testing</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Dr. {!Contact.LastName},

The NCCN just updated its non-small cell lung cancer guidelines to include plasma-based molecular testing for the first time. [1]

We are glad to see the guidelines recognize the value of plasma-based genotyping. As oncologists like you already know, comprehensive liquid biopsy with Guardant360 provides a non-invasive method for determining your patientsâ€™ eligibility for targeted therapies. This is particularly relevant when tissue is unavailable for testing, or at progression to avoid the risks and complications of a repeat biopsy.

This is a great step forward for the clinical use of liquid biopsy, a technology Guardant Health pioneered in 2014.

Given these new guidelines, do you or a colleague have some time this week to discuss which of your advanced cancer patients might be right for testing with Guardant360? Please feel free to contact me any time.

Sincerely,
{!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName}
