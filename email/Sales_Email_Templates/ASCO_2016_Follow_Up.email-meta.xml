    <textOnly>Dear Dr. {!Contact.LastName},

As promised I am following up with our posters, presentation and press as well as specific next steps from our meeting.

Please follow this Box link to access the posters we can share (some being held back for publication purposes) along with the presentation Phil Mack of UC Davis gave on the results from our first 15,000 patients.

We were thrilled this data was selected for one of the late breaking abstracts and you can access the press release here, as well subsequent stories in the New York Times, Washington Post, Economist, Fortune, Business Insider and Time, among others.

Our partners at Samsung Medical Center presented data from the first prospective clinical utility trial of 200 patients using results from Guardant360 testing and achieved 88% response rate in lung and 60% response rate in gastric. Press release here and Fierce Medical Devices story here.

Furthermore, lots of people have been asking about our early detection project, LUNAR. Here is a link to the press release and Guardant landing page.

Best,
{!Contact.OwnerFullName}
