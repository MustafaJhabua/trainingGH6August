    <subject>End of the year update from Guardant Health</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Dr. {!Contact.LastName},

I hope you are enjoying the holiday season. Before the year ends, I wanted to make sure you saw that Guardant Health had a Podium presentation and 8 accepted abstracts/posters at the World Lung Conference held in Vienna, Austria, between December 4th and 7th 2016.

Clinical utility of Guardant360 in &gt;8000+ NSCLC patients, 45% ORR for Guardant-selected patients, detection of ALK fusions missed by FISH testing, and potential utility in Squamous Cell Carcinoma were some of the key highlights of the studies presented.

Top study details

- 8,388-NSCLC-patient data on the clinical utility of Guardant360 presented by Dr. Philip Mack, PhD, showing the test helped identify FDA-approved therapy options in 38% of patients, based on alterations detected in 6 guideline-recommended genes: EGFR, ALK, ROS1, RET, MET and BRAF.

- 92-NSCLC-patient study with clinical outcomes by Dr Nir Peled, Davidoff Cancer Center, Israel, in which Guardant360 identified FDA-approved therapy options in 62% of patients, treatment was impacted in 25% of patients, and the ORR in treated patients was 45%

Please follow this link to view these and the other posters our collaborators presented in Vienna.
