    <textOnly>Thank you, Dr. {!Match_Record__c.MD_Last_Name__c},

[Option 1: Response to IOE] Per your request, I have included information about the RNT-701 clinical study below as well as assigned one of our Clinical Trial Advisor physicians to contact you via phone this week to further discuss the clinical trial options for your patient who had an EGFR or ERBB2 mutation. [Option 1]

[Option 2: Follow-up after phone conversation] It was great speaking with you regarding your patient  {!Match_Record__c.Patient_Initials__c} ({!Match_Record__c.Patient_Age__c} yo {!Match_Record__c.Patient_Gender__c} with {!Match_Record__c.Cancer_Type_Lower_Case__c}) who was found to have an EGFR exon 20 insertion OR ERBB2 mutation. To view your patient&apos;s Guardant360 report, click here: {!Match_Record__c.Portal_Link_For_MD_text__c}. Further to our discussion about your patient’s Guardant360 report, you expressed an interest in exploring treatment options based on the EGFR or ERBB2 mutation detected. [Option 2]

Since EGFR and ERBB2 mutations are uncommon, we have partnered with Rain Therapeutics and formed a business and financial relationship to help identify patients and to alert treating physicians about their treatment and trial options for patients like  {!Match_Record__c.Patient_Initials__c}. Your patient may be eligible for [X NUMBER] of clinical trials as indicated on the Guardant360 report, including:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A Phase 2 Study of Tarloxotinib in Patients With NSCLC Harboring EGFR Exon 20 Insertion or HER2-activating Mutations (RAIN), NCT03805841&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;u&gt;RNT-701: Rain Therapeutics&lt;/u&gt;
Rain’s trial involves a drug called tarloxotinib. Additionally, travel assistance is available for eligible patients and caregivers to reduce out-of-pocket expenses. Details of this trial are in the attached PDF and can be found at https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03805841.
 
The closest study site is at {!Match_Record__c.Closest_Trial_Site__c} in {!Match_Record__c.Closest_Trial_Site_City__c}, {!Match_Record__c.Closest_Trial_Site_State__c} with Dr. {PI Full Name}; additional study sites are also available around the US.

&lt;strong&gt;Would you like me to connect you with {PI Full Name} via email so they may answer additional questions regarding eligibility, inclusion/criteria, etc. for the RNT-701 study?&lt;/strong&gt;

Sincerely,
