Thank you, Dr. {!Match_Record__c.MD_Last_Name__c},

[Option 1: Response to IOE] Per your request, I have included information about the LOXO-292 clinical study below as well as assigned one of our Clinical Trial Advisor physicians to contact you via phone this week to further discuss the clinical trial options for your patient who had a RET fusion. [Option 1]

[Option 2: Follow-up after phone conversation] It was great speaking with you regarding your patient {!Match_Record__c.Patient_Initials__c} ({!Match_Record__c.Patient_Age__c} yo {!Match_Record__c.Patient_Gender__c} with {!Match_Record__c.Cancer_Type_Lower_Case__c}) who was found to have a RET alteration. To view your patient's Guardant360 report, click here: {!Match_Record__c.Portal_Link_For_MD_text__c}. Further to our discussion about your patientâ€™s Guardant360 report, you expressed an interest in exploring treatment options based on the RET alteration detected. [Option 2]

Since RET alterations are uncommon, we have partnered with Loxo Oncology and formed a business and financial relationship to help identify patients for the LOXO-292 (LIBRETTO-001) study and to alert treating physicians about their treatment and trial options for patients like {!Match_Record__c.Patient_Initials__c}. Your patient may be eligible for [X NUMBER] clinical trials as indicated on the Guardant360 report, including: <ul><li>Phase 1/2 Study of LOXO-292 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors, RET Fusion-Positive Solid Tumors, and Medullary Thyroid Cancer (LIBRETTO-001), NCT03157128</li></ul>

<u>LOXO-292: Loxo Oncology</u>
LOXO-292 may inhibit RET signaling (including mutations and rearrangements/fusions) and is open to patients with non-small cell lung cancer, medullary thyroid cancer, colon cancer, and other RET-altered advanced solid tumors. More information on the LOXO-292 trial including clinical data from ASCO 2018 can be found in the attached PDF and at https://ClinicalTrials.gov/show/NCT03157128.
 
<strong>The closest LOXO-292 study site is {!Match_Record__c.Closest_Trial_Site__c} in {!Match_Record__c.Closest_Trial_Site_City__c}, {!Match_Record__c.Closest_Trial_Site_State__c} with Dr. {PI Name};</strong> additional study sites and financial support for patient travel and accommodations is available.
