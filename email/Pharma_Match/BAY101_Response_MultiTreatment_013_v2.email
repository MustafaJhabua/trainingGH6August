Thank you, Dr. {!Match_Record__c.MD_Last_Name__c},

Per your request, I am providing information regarding NTRK gene fusions below and have assigned one of our Clinical Trial Advisor physicians to contact you via phone this week to further discuss treatment options for your patient.

Since NTRK1 fusions are uncommon, we have partnered with Bayer and formed a business and financial relationship to help identify patients and to alert treating physicians about Bayerâ€™s treatment option for patients like {!Match_Record__c.Patient_Initials__c}. Larotrectinib has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with solid tumors that have a neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase (NTRK) gene fusion without a known acquired resistance mutation, who are metastatic, or where surgical resection is likely to result in severe morbidity and have no satisfactory alternative treatments or that have progressed following treatment. More information can be found by <a

Would you like us to directly connect you with a Bayer sales consultant?

Sincerely,
