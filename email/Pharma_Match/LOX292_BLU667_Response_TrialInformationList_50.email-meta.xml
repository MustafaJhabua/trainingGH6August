    <textOnly>Thank you, Dr. {!Contact.LastName}.

[Option 1: Response to IOE] Per your request, I have included information about the BLU-667 and LOXO-292 clinical study below as well as assigned one of our Clinical Trial Advisor physicians to contact you via phone this week to further discuss these clinical trial options for your patient who had a RET alteration. [Option 1]

[Option 2: Follow-up after phone conversation] It was great speaking with you regarding your patient {!Match_Record__c.Patient_Initials__c} ({!Match_Record__c.Patient_Age__c} yo {!Match_Record__c.Patient_Gender__c} with {!Match_Record__c.Cancer_Type_Lower_Case__c}) who was found to have an a RET alteration fusion. To view your patient&apos;s Guardant360 report, click here: {!Match_Record__c.Portal_Link_For_MD_text__c}. Further to our discussion about your patient’s Guardant360 report, you expressed an interest in exploring treatment options based on the a RET alteration detected. [Option 2]

Since RET alterations are uncommon, we have partnered with Blueprint Medicines and Loxo Oncology and formed a business and financial relationship to help identify patients for their studies. As a part of this partnership we alert treating physicians about treatment and trial options for patients like {!Match_Record__c.Patient_Initials__c}. Your patient may be eligible for [X NUMBER] of clinical trials as indicated on the Guardant360 report, including [BULLETED MENTION OF ADDITIONAL TRIALS].
